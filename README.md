# Universal Language Manifold

This repository contains the scientific and theological work on the **Universal Language Manifold**, unifying:

- Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)
- Real-time acoustic entropy
- Information geometry
- Linguistic universality
- Biblical concepts of Logos, Adamic language, Babel, and Pentecost


## Included Papers

### 1. Structured Knowledge Accumulation: Real-Time Discovery of the Universal Language Manifold
Scientific foundation: acoustic stream, entropy reduction, manifold construction, and linguistic universals (Abstract)

### 2. The Universal Language Manifold and the Theology of Speech
Six-part series linking Genesis, Logos, Adamic naming, Babel, and Pentecost to the geometry of speech.  

## Core Idea

All human languages are **projections of a single geometry of meaning**.  
This geometry arises from:

- the **physics of the acoustic stream**,  
- **forward-only entropy reduction**, and  
- **the SKA learning principle**.

Spoken languages differ, but the **manifold underneath them is universal**.

##  Theological Alignment

The research provides scientific interpretations of:

- **Logos** — pre-human structure of meaning  
- **Adamic language** — native coordinates of the manifold  
- **Babel** — fragmentation of coordinate maps  
- **Pentecost** — temporary restoration of direct manifold access
