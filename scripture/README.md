# README – About the Selected Hebrew Audio Stream

This project uses the **Talking Bibles International (1992)** Hebrew audio recording as the official audio stream for the Hebrew–English Bible.
The reasons for this choice are:

### 1. **Clear, Standard Hebrew Pronunciation**

The recordings use **Sephardic-style Hebrew**, spoken clearly and slowly.
They are **not chanted** and contain **no musical trop**, making them ideal for linguistic study, pronunciation practice, and textual research.

### 2. **Book–by–Book Structure**

Each book of the Tanakh (Torah, Prophets, Writings) is provided as a **separate MP3 file**.
This matches the structure of the Hebrew–English text used in this project, making it easy to:

* follow along chapter by chapter,
* link verses to audio during study,
* create synchronized study materials.

### 3. **High–Quality Offline Access**

The original files are quite large, which ensures high-quality audio.
Once downloaded, the MP3s can be:

* replayed offline,
* transferred to any audio device,
* burned to CD, or
* integrated with digital study tools.

### 4. **Legitimate Use With Permission**

Talking Bibles International allows use of these recordings with permission ([info@talkingbibles.org](mailto:info@talkingbibles.org)).
Their long-standing work ensures the audio is trustworthy, preserved, and freely accessible for educational use.

### 5. **Consistency Across the Entire Bible**

The full Old Testament / Tanakh is covered:

* **Torah:** Genesis–Deuteronomy
* **Prophets (Nevi’im):** Joshua–Malachi
* **Writings (Ketuvim):** Chronicles–Daniel–Ezra/Nehemiah

This provides a complete and uniform audio source for all books listed in the Hebrew–English edition.
